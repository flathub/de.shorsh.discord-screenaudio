  "end-of-life": "This project isn't actively maintained anymore, and has been taken down from Flathub because of that and because of trademark issues. I mainly recommend using and contributing to Vesktop as an alternative Discord client with great audio screensharing support, but a list of other alternatives can also be found at https://github.com/maltejur/discord-screenaudio#alternatives."
